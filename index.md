# Hello and welcome! I'm a recent graduate (BA) of Washington University in St. Louis with a major in Physics and a minor in German.
### I'm interested in the science of complexity, particularly in many-body effects in condensed matter systems and the emergence of higher-order cognitive phenomena from neural circuitry. As someone, who likes getting their hands dirty, I'm interested in how we might build "hardware" for cognitive agents and the next generation of computing. I'm also interested in and concerned with the political effects of science and technology. My last semester, I had the opportunity to read and translate some original texts from the [Frankfurt School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School), and I reviewed (for readers of German) a recent English language book, [<em>Grand Hotel Abyss: The Lives of the Frankfurt School</em>](https://www.versobooks.com/books/2501-grand-hotel-abyss). Review available [here](eugenejtsao.github.io/BuchkritikPDF.pdf). I'm a runner and dancer too, and I try to bring practices like [Alexander Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique) into my movement when I'm not too distracted with other things!
### During my junior and senior years at Wash U, I conducted research in the [Henriksen Research Group](http://physics.wustl.edu/henriksen/), designing, building, and analyzing an ensemble of freely rotating and interacting bar magnets that models a spin glass at a macroscopic level. You can find my senior thesis on this research [here](eugenejtsao.github.io/Thesis Final 2.0.pdf), my CV [here](eugenejtsao.github.io/WebCV_6:16:17.pdf), and my resume [here](eugenejtsao.github.io/ResumeInternet.pdf).
