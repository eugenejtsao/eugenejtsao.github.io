# Welcome! I'm a recent graduate (BA) in Physics of Washington University in St. Louis.
### My interests in STEM include many-body effects in condensed matter systems, quantum information, neural networks, and theory of learning (in particular deep learning and what success in AI implementation tells us about the nature of cognition). I'm also interested in and concerned with the socio-political effects of science and technology, and am broadly interested in political economy (current read is Thomas Pickety's _Capital in the 21st Century_). I love movement and sports, and I try to bring practices like [Alexander Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique) and [Authentic Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentic_Movement) into my running/tennis/soccer/dance/most everything!
### During my junior and senior years at Wash U, I conducted research in the [Henriksen Experimental Physics Lab](http://physics.wustl.edu/henriksen/), designing and building a classical spin-glass analogue out of freely rotating and interacting bar magnets. You can find my senior thesis on this research [here](eugenejtsao.github.io/Thesis Final 2.0.pdf), my CV [here](eugenejtsao.github.io/WebCV_6:16:17.pdf), and my resume [here](eugenejtsao.github.io/ResumeInternet.pdf).
