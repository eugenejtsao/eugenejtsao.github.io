# Hello and welcome! I'm a recent graduate (BA) of Washington University in St. Louis with a major in Physics and a minor in German.
### As a scientist, I am interested notions of complexity--including many-body effects in condensed matter systems, and the emergence of higher-order cognitive phenomena from neural circuitry. As someone who likes getting their hands dirty, I'm interested in how we might build cognitive agents and the next generation of computing. It's an exciting time to be alive! I'm also interested in and concerned with the socio-political effects of science and technology, and am broadly interested in political economy (current read is Thomas Pickety's _Capital in the 21st Century_). I love movement and sports, and I try to bring practices like [Alexander Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique) and [Authentic Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentic_Movement) into my running/tennis/soccer/dance/most everything!
### During my junior and senior years at Wash U, I conducted research in the [Henriksen Experimental Physics Lab](http://physics.wustl.edu/henriksen/), designing and building a classical spin-glass analogue out of freely rotating and interacting bar magnets. You can find my senior thesis on this research [here](eugenejtsao.github.io/Thesis Final 2.0.pdf), my CV [here](eugenejtsao.github.io/WebCV_6:16:17.pdf), and my resume [here](eugenejtsao.github.io/ResumeInternet.pdf).
